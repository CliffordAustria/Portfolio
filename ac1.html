									<h2>What is design?</h2>
									<p>For me design is intended to create an item such as cars, appliances, house etc. Specification
										of an entity or device design or of the operation or procedure to be carried out. The common task of
										design has been to enhance the visual presentation of communication and their work. The
										publishing industry depends on designers to educate, entertain, and support readers' interests in
										printed and electronic books, magazines, and newspapers. (Aiga)</p>
									<h2> What is User Design?</h2>
									<p>System design teams use this to develop products that provide consumers with practical and
										appropriate experience. This includes the design of the entire product development and integration
										cycle including branding, architecture, usability, and functional aspects. (foundation)</p>
									<h2> What is the difference between User Experience Design and User Interface Design? Why does it matter?</h2>
									<p>UX design refers to "user experience design" while "user interface design" refers to UI design.
										Both components are essential to a product and interact closely. Yet despite their common
										connection, the tasks themselves are quite different, relating to quite different aspects of the method
										of product creation and the discipline of design. Before discussing the key differences between UX
										and UI, let us first describe what each individual term means. (LAMPRECHT, 2019)</p>
									<p>UX Design includes all interactions between an active or potential customer and a company.
										It could be extended to anything as a scientific process, streetlamps, cars, Ikea shelving and so on.
										While being a scientific term, however, its usage has been almost entirely within digital realms since
										its inception. One reason for that is that the tech industry began to blow up around the time of the
										invention of the term. (LAMPRECHT, 2019)</p>
									<p>The user interface design is a compliment to it; the look and feel, the product presentation
										and interactivity. Yet like UX, the industries that employ UI designers are easily and sometimes
										confused â€” to the point that multiple job posts frequently refer to the profession as entirely
										different items. (LAMPRECHT, 2019)</p>
									<h2> Who are the users? Why are they important?</h2>
									<p>In my view, the user is the one who uses the program or websites such as Facebook,
										Instagram, Twitter and so on. User experience is important because it tries to satisfy the needs of the user. This seeks to
										have meaningful interactions that will keep the product or company loyal to a customer. Therefore, a
										positive user interface allows you to identify consumer experiences that are most conducive to
										business success on your product. (Gangadharan, 2019)</p>
