									<h2>What is design thinking?</h2>
									<p>Design thinking, the term that comes to my mind is the process where, when making design, you can create up your model. Building a design that we work on and addressing the challenge we face. After doing so, you can effectively create a good concept and create a design effectively. In design thinking, there is also a different process where we can quickly create a solution with our idea.</p>
									<p>Design thinking is a creative method of problem-solving rooted in a collection of skills. The methodology has been around for decades, but after the 2008 Harvard Business Review article [subscription required] entitled 'Design Thinking' by Tim Brown, CEO and President of IDEO, the design firm, it really began to gain popularity in the design world. (Linke, 2017)</p>
									<p>The steps involved in the design thinking process are clear at a high level: first, thoroughly understand the issue; second, consider a wide variety of potential solutions; third, systematically iterate through prototyping and testing; and finally, execute through the normal processes of implementation. (Linke, 2017)</p>
									<p>The talents associated with these measures help individuals apply ingenuity to solve real-world challenges efficiently faster than they would otherwise. They can be taught quickly, but it takes time. For example, putting aside your own preconceptions is crucial when attempting to solve a dilemma, but it is difficult. For the creation of viable ideas, innovative brainstorming is important, however many people do not do it especially well. And it is important to engage in simulation, study, prototyping, and checking during the entire process, and to really benefit from these multiple iterations. (Linke, 2017)</p>
